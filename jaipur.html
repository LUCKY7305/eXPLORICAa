      <h1>Welcome to Jaipur</h1>
      <p>
        Jaipur, the capital city of Rajasthan, is a vibrant destination known for its rich history, royal heritage, and stunning architecture. Dubbed the "Pink City" due to the unique pink-hued buildings in its historic center, Jaipur is a major cultural and historical hub in India. It is part of the Golden Triangle, along with Delhi and Agra, making it a popular tourist destination.
        </p>
      <p>
        Founded in 1727 by Maharaja Jai Singh II, Jaipur was carefully planned according to Vastu Shastra, a traditional Hindu system of architecture. The city’s layout is a blend of ancient traditions and modern planning, with broad streets, intricate architecture, and grandiose structures. The historical charm of Jaipur is reflected in its palaces, forts, and temples, each telling the story of the Rajput kings and their glorious past.
      </p>
    <p>
        The most iconic landmark in Jaipur is the Hawa Mahal, also known as the Palace of Winds. Its five-story façade, adorned with intricately designed windows, was built to allow royal women to observe street festivals without being seen by the public. Another must-visit site is the Amber Fort, a stunning blend of Hindu and Mughal architectural styles, located on a hilltop with breathtaking views of the surrounding landscape. City Palace, another architectural marvel, houses museums, courtyards, and gardens, showcasing the opulence and lifestyle of the royal family.
      </p>
    <p>
        Jaipur is also home to the Jantar Mantar, an astronomical observatory built by Maharaja Jai Singh II. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and features the world’s largest stone sundial. Another iconic structure is the Albert Hall Museum, which showcases a rich collection of artifacts, including sculptures, paintings, and textiles.
      </p>
    <p>
        The city’s vibrant culture extends to its bustling bazaars and markets, where you can shop for traditional Rajasthani handicrafts, textiles, jewelry, and souvenirs. The Johari Bazaar and Bapu Bazaar are famous for their colorful displays of textiles, carpets, and silver jewelry. Tripolia Bazaar is known for its exquisite lac jewelry, while Chandpole Bazaar offers a variety of handmade pottery and traditional Rajasthani clothing.
      </p>
    <p>
        Jaipur is also renowned for its festivals, with Teej and Gangaur being the most widely celebrated. These festivals are marked by grand processions, traditional dances, and elaborate rituals. The Jaipur Literature Festival is another major event that attracts writers, poets, and intellectuals from across the globe.
      
      </p>
        <p>
        Rajasthani cuisine, rich in spices and flavors, is another highlight of Jaipur. Dishes like dal baati churma, gatte ki sabzi, and laal maas (spicy mutton curry) are local favorites. You can also indulge in sweets like ghewar, mawa kachori, and jalebi. The street food in Jaipur, particularly pani puri, kachori, and samosas, is a must-try for food lovers.
      </p>
    <p>
        The city's infrastructure has modernized over the years, with upscale hotels, resorts, and shopping malls complementing its historical charm. Jaipur is also an emerging center for arts, crafts, and theater, and the annual Jaipur International Film Festival further enriches its cultural scene.
      </p>
    <p>
        Despite its modernity, Jaipur retains its historical charm, making it an ideal destination for travelers seeking a combination of heritage, culture, and contemporary experiences. Whether you're exploring its majestic forts and palaces, shopping in its lively markets, or enjoying its rich cuisine, Jaipur promises an unforgettable experience.</p>
